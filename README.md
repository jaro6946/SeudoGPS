# SeudoGPS
The intent of this program is to be able to track the locations of several unique colored LEDs on a x-y grid, it will post these locations into a database.


The program will determine which colors to track by first performing an initialization shot with no lights on, then a shot with the lights on.  The only differences in the images should be the LEDs.
